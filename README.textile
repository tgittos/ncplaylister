h1. NCPlaylister

NCPlaylister is a tool to build Spotify playlists out of radio show playlists published online, specifically the No Control show on 101.5X in Austin, TX.

It is built on top of libspotify and the Hallon gem.

h2. Installing

Details about how to install libspotify and Hallon can be found on the Hallon github repository.

h2. Running

Run ncplaylister.rb, and it will poll the website and retrieve the Spotify tracks. It will ask you for a playlist to put all the tracks into (because I can't figure out how to create a playlist with libspotify).

h2. Notes

This is online mostly as a reference with using Hallon and programming with Spotify.
